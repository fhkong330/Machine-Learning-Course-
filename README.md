# Machine-Learning-Course-
Course Description This course provides an introduction to the application of machine learning models to financial 
markets. No previous experience in machine learning is needed, but students should be comfortable programming in 
Jupyter notebooks using Python. Students will need access to Google.colab (available to all who have a Google drive 
account). Emphasis will be on creating a solid understanding of standard machine learning models with priority given 
to models and model validation techniques most frequently used in the areas of market strategy, risk management, 
and credit analysis. Each class will be a mix of theory and hands-on programming.  

Topics covered include  
• implementation and backtesting of quant trading models 
• Decision tree and linear supervised learning models 
• Neural networks and time series neural network models 
• Clustering and other unsupervised learning models 
• Reinforcement learning
